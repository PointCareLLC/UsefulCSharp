Given When Then unit testing pattern.

This library provides a base class to help facilitate and structure the Given When Then patter.  
One of the best features is the use oF the DLR for the Givens.  You can define any Given property on the fly without having previously defined it.  This probably sounds like C# heresy but it's true.
